# Peter Bloomfield's blog
This repository contains the contents of my personal blog about software engineering. It uses the
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator, with the [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/).

This repository probably won't be very useful to anyone else, but you're welcome to take a look at
how it's built. If you want to build your own similar blog, please see the Jekyll and Chirpy
documentation at the above links.
