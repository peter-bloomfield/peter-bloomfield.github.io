***Peter Russell Bloomfield** PhD, MBCS, BSc (Hons)*

This website is my personal blog about technical topics related to my job as a software engineer,
along with anything interesting I encounter in my professional development and personal projects.

I've been programming professionally since 2007, and before that as a hobby since the early 90s.
I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer at Smoothwall (part of Family Zone), where we make
software to protect and support the safety and wellbeing of millions of children throughout the
world.

I'm a member of the [British Computer Society](https://www.bcs.org) and
[British Mensa](https://www.mensa.org.uk/). In my free time, I enjoy archery, playing the piano,
board games, and attempting DIY (with varying degrees of success!). I also have a crazy beagle who
keeps me far too busy.
