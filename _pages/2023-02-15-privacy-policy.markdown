## Who I am

My name is Peter Bloomfield and this is my personal website/blog.

The address is: [https://bloomfield.online](https://bloomfield.online)

## Purpose

The main purpose of this website is for me to publish articles I have written in my free time which I think may be of help or interest to others. The content may relate to my professional experience as a software engineer, or it may relate to technical or other topics I have pursued in my own time. Either way, please note that this website is non-commercial and is not involved in selling or marketing. However, the website may show adverts or use other means of raising money (such as affiliate links) to help with running costs.

## Hosting

This website is hosted as static content on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Traffic is routed via [CloudFlare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

The source code for this website is available on GitHub here: [https://github.com/peter-bloomfield/peter-bloomfield.github.io](https://github.com/peter-bloomfield/peter-bloomfield.github.io)

## What personal data I collect and why I collect it

### Comments

This website has previously used a platform called [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) to allow visitors to comment on my blog posts. This was disabled as part of a recent migration to a new platform, although it may be re-enabled in future. The Disqus privacy policy can be found here: [https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy)

Comments (and related data) are not stored as part of this website. They are stored externally.

### Contact forms

At the time of writing, this website does not have a contact form.

### User accounts

This website does not implement, use, or require user accounts or similar registration or login mechanisms. All visitors can access all parts of the website anonymously.

Control over the content of this website is managed via GitHub.

### Cookies

Cookies may be used for the purpose of preventing spam, as well as for analytics and advertising (see below).

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this website may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in exactly same way as if the visitor has visited the website it came from.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. I do not have control over this.

### Analytics

This website has previously used Google Analytics to monitor usage and popularity. This was disabled as part of a recent migration. Similar functionality may be added again in future. However, the data collected will be anonymised, and will be used only to help improve the website, such as by making high-traffic pages more usable and efficient, and identifying popular topics for future posts.

### Adverts

This website does not currently display any adverts. However, that may change in future.

### Affiliate links

From time to time, this website may include affiliate links from various providers. These links will be clearly marked as such, enabling you to avoid using them if you so choose.

If you choose to follow such a link and purchase the relevant product or service then I may receive some revenue or other benefit. The purpose of this is to contribute to the costs of running this website.

## Who I share your data with

I do not share your data with any person, organisation, or other entity.

## How long I retain your data

Personally identifiable data about you is never gathered or retained. Anonymised or pseudonymised statistics may be retained indefinitely for purposes of analysing traffic patterns.

## What rights you have over your data

I do not store any personal data about website visitors. If you think I am storing data about you then you are welcome to ask for a copy of it, and/or ask for it to be amended/deleted.

If your query or request relates to the analytics or adverts used on this website then I may need to refer you to the provider of that service.

## Where I send your data

I do not send your data anywhere.
