## Who I am

My name is Peter Bloomfield and this is my personal website/blog.

The address is: [https://bloomfield.online](https://bloomfield.online)

In the past, my blog has also appeared at the following locations:

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is for me to publish articles I have written in my free time and which I think may be of help or interest to others. The content may relate to my professional experience as a software engineer, or it may relate to technical or other topics I have pursued in my own time.

This website is non-commercial and is not involved in selling or marketing. However, it may show adverts or share affiliate links to help with running costs.

## Hosting

This website is hosted as static content on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Traffic is routed via [CloudFlare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

The source code for this website is available on GitHub here: [https://github.com/peter-bloomfield/peter-bloomfield.github.io](https://github.com/peter-bloomfield/peter-bloomfield.github.io)

## What personal data I collect and why I collect it

### Comments

This website has previously used a platform called [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) to enable visitors to post comments. This was disabled as part of a recent migration to a new platform, although it may be re-enabled in future. The Disqus privacy policy can be found here: [https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy)

### Contact forms

At the time of writing, this website does not have any forms you can fill in to contact me. However, such a form may be introduced in future. In that case, the information entered into the form will be emailed to me. It will not be stored anywhere else. Anonymised information, such as your IP address, may be stored to help prevent spam.

### User accounts

This website does not implement, use, or require user accounts or other registration or login mechanisms. All visitors can access all parts of the website freely and anonymously.

### Cookies

Cookies may be used for the purpose of analytics and preventing spam.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this website may include embedded content (e.g. YouTube videos). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the same way as if you had visited the website it came from. Such websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. I do not have control over this, nor do I have any access to the data gathered.

### Analytics

This website uses a service called [Goat Counter](https://www.goatcounter.com) to count page views. The purpose is to identify which articles are most popular so that my efforts can focus on similar content in the future.

### Adverts

This website does not currently display any adverts. However, that may change in future.

### Affiliate links

From time to time, this website may include affiliate links from various providers. These links will be clearly marked as such, enabling you to avoid using them if you so choose. If you follow such a link then the destination website may gather data about you. If you purchase a product or service via the link then I may receive some revenue or other benefit. The purpose of this will be to contribute to the costs of running this website.

## Who I share your data with

I do not share your data with any person, organisation, or other entity.

## How long I retain your data

I do not gather or retain any personally identifiable data about visitors to this website. Anonymous or aggregated statistics (e.g. total page views) may be retained indefinitely for the purpose of improving the website.

## What rights you have over your data

This is not applicable as no personal data is currently gathered.

## Where I send your data

I do not send your data anywhere.
