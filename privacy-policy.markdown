## Who I am

My name is Peter Bloomfield and this is my personal website/blog.

The address is: [https://bloomfield.online](https://bloomfield.online)

In the past, my blog has also appeared at the following locations:

## Purpose

The purpose of this website is for me to publish articles I have written in my free time and which I think may be helpful or interesting to others. The content may relate to my professional experience as a software engineer, or it may relate to technical or other topics I have pursued in my own time.

This website is non-commercial and is not involved in selling or marketing. However, it may show adverts or share affiliate links to help with running costs.

## Hosting

This website is hosted as static content on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), and the traffic is routed via [Cloudflare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cdn/). To the best of my knowledge, Cloudflare does not gather or track personally identifiable information about visitors to my website. However, it may log some general information regarding usage patterns and potential malicious activity. Cloudflare's policies can be found here:

- [https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/](https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/)

## What personal data I collect and why I collect it

### User accounts

This website does not implement, use, or require user accounts or other registration or login mechanisms. All visitors can access all parts of the website freely and anonymously.

### Comments

This website has previously used a platform called [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) to enable visitors to post comments. This was disabled as part of a recent migration to a new platform, although it may be re-enabled in future. The Disqus privacy policy can be found here:

- [https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy)

### Contact form

The "[Contact Me]({% link _tabs/contact-me.md %})" page contains a form you can use to send me an email. The purpose is to provide the option to communicate directly with me if you think it is necessary or useful. You are under no obligation to use the form. It will only process the information you enter when you click the submit button. 

Messages sent to me may be stored indefinitely in my personal email account, associated backups, or other storage mechanisms which are only accessible by me. At any time, you can request that I delete any messages you have sent, along with any records of your name and contact information. To do this, you will need to send me a message. If the "[Contact Me]({% link _tabs/contact-me.md %})" page is not working, or you would prefer not to use it, then you can alternatively contact me through LinkedIn or Twitter (see Contact Information below).

The form is processed by [Formspree (formspree.io)](https://formspree.io/), and the information you enter will be stored on their servers for 30 days. They may also store other information such as your IP address during that time to help prevent spam. The Formspree privacy policy is available here:

- [https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy](https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy/)

The form also uses [reCAPTCHA Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise) by Google to prevent spam. It may use cookies and other information to determine whether you are a real user.

### Analytics

This website uses a service called [Goat Counter (goatcounter.com)](https://www.goatcounter.com) to count page views. The purpose is to improve the website. This includes:

* Identifying which posts/pages are most popular so that I can focus on producing the most helpful and relevant content.
* Understanding how visitors typically reach this website so that I can make it easier to find.
* Determine what devices visitors typically use to view this website so that accessibility can be improved if necessary.

The information gathered by Goat Counter is:

* **Referrer** (the website which linked you to this website, if applicable)
* The type of **browser** you are using to access this website (e.g. Chrome, Firefox)
* The family of **Operating System** you are using to access this website (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux)
* The general **category of device** you are using to access this website (e.g. tablet, phone, computer)
* The **country** from which you are accessing this website

The data gathered is aggregated, and contains no personally identifiable information. It is never matched to your activity on any other website.

I have configured my instance of Goat Counter to delete data after 1 year.

### Adverts

This website does not currently display any adverts. However, that may change in future.

### Affiliate links

From time to time, this website may include affiliate links from various providers. These links will be clearly marked as such, enabling you to avoid using them if you so choose. If you follow such a link then the destination website may gather data about you. If you purchase a product or service via the link then I may receive some revenue or other benefit. The purpose of this will be to contribute to the costs of running this website.

### Cookies

Cookies may be used for the purpose of analytics and preventing spam. These usages are noted in other sections of this document.

You can delete cookies from your system at any time. You can also configure your browser to reject any use of cookies on this website. You should still be able to access all content. However, disabling cookies may prevent you from leaving comments or sending me messages via the contact form.

## Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this website may include embedded content (e.g. YouTube videos). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the same way as if you had visited the website it came from. Such websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. I do not have control over this, nor do I have any access to the data gathered.

## Data handling

Your data is not shared or transferred for any other reason, and it is never sold.

### How long I retain your data

The retention period of your data depends on the individual purpose. It is described in other sections of this document.

It is not possible to selectively delete such data after it has been gathered. However, using your browser settings, you can take steps to avoid having data gathered in the first place, as noted below.

The only personally identifiable information gathered by this website is anything you voluntarily submit via the "Contact Me" page. You are under to obligation to use this feature. If you have used it previously, then you are welcome to contact me to ask me to delete your data (as noted above).
